# Note-Taker

## Description:
This is an simple note-taker web application that allows user to write and save notes with the help of Express.js in the back end. 

The application's front end was already created, this was an code refactoring project to build the back-end, and connect with the front-end, which I have learned to struggle to grasp the idea of path and routes, but it was fun to see all the codes to work together in the end.
